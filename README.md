# NanoFi


## Speed up data transfer from iOS to Apple Watch rate

By default, Apple Watch prioritized Bluetooth connection, which makes transferring of music etc. very slow. NanoFi attempts to make WiFi as default connection. Note that your Apple Watch needs to be connected to local WiFi network (auto-join) for this to work.

It comes with a Control Center module. The module acts as an intermediate switch where sometimes the request to utilize WiFi failed due to Apple Watch not responsive to our request and you might want to re-request the operation. I have no control over this as without knowing how watchOS works internally, this is the best I could do.


## Compatibility
This package tested to be working on iPhone X iOS 14.3, and with Apple Watch S5 on watchOS 7.3.3. Might or might not work on different combinations.
